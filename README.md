# Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning

Various diseases affect people today because of the environment and their lifestyle
choices. Predicting sickness early on so becomes a crucial task. However, based just
on symptoms, doctors find it difficult to make exact predictions. The hardest
challenge is to accurately predict diseases.
The development of a Disease Symptoms Prediction Application based on machine
learning (ML) algorithms for illness prediction can aid in a more accurate diagnosis
than the current methods. Using Supervised machine-learning techniques, we created
a disease prediction system
